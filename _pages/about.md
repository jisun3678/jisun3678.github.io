I am an engineer who thrives at the intersection of embedded systems and robotics, with a particular focus on SLAM and path planning. My career journey began with a passion for firmware development, where I honed my skills in programming 8- to 32-bit microcontrollers and designing efficient systems from concept to mass production. My expertise spans from low-level hardware to high-level software, allowing me to integrate diverse technologies and deliver practical, scalable solutions.

While leading firmware development for energy management systems and IoT devices, I became fascinated by the potential of robotics and autonomous systems. This interest led me to pursue projects in environmental mapping and autonomous navigation. By leveraging LiDAR and camera data, I have developed systems that ensure precise environment perception and safe path planning algorithms.

A defining feature of my work is my problem-solving mindset. Whether optimizing firmware for IoT devices or implementing advanced SLAM algorithms, I approach challenges with a proactive and determined attitude. My ability to bridge embedded systems with robotics allows me to create solutions that are both efficient and innovative.

Recently, my focus has expanded to include research and development in robotics, particularly in SLAM and trajectory planning. At RGA Inc., I have developed 2D and 3D mapping systems using tools like Gazebo, ROS, and Docker. My work includes testing algorithms such as A*, RRT, and MPC, as well as sensor integration and real-time data visualization. This experience has solidified my expertise in robotic perception and control.

I am committed to advancing technologies that connect the digital and physical worlds. By combining my skills in embedded firmware, robotics, and software development, I strive to create systems that are not only technologically advanced but also impactful in real-world applications. My ultimate goal is to design solutions that enhance the efficiency, safety, and intelligence of autonomous systems, contributing to a future where technology seamlessly integrates into our lives.
