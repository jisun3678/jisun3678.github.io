I began my career in engineering with a focus on embedded systems, fascinated by how microcontrollers could bring complex functionality to life in the real world. My work initially revolved around low-level firmware development, ensuring that each chip I programmed could operate seamlessly in its intended environment. This early experience instilled in me a strong foundation in creating efficient and reliable systems that bridge the gap between hardware and software.

Over time, my curiosity expanded from the micro-scale intricacies of embedded systems to the macro-scale challenges of robotics. Observing how hardware could interact dynamically with the physical world led me to explore autonomous systems and, ultimately, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) technology. SLAM captivated me because it combines precision and adaptability, allowing robots to understand and navigate complex environments.

This transition from embedded systems to robotics has shaped my approach to problem-solving. Whether designing firmware for IoT devices or developing algorithms for environmental mapping, I have always prioritized the seamless integration of components into a cohesive, reliable system. My work on SLAM and path planning reflects this philosophy, as it requires both micro-level precision in sensor integration and macro-level system design to ensure robust navigation in real-world scenarios.

What drives me is a commitment to creating systems that contribute meaningfully to society. I believe that technology should not only function but also positively impact the world by enhancing efficiency, safety, and connectivity. From developing firmware for smart energy management systems to designing SLAM solutions for autonomous robots, I am deeply motivated by the idea of bringing order and intelligence to complex systems.

As I continue to bridge embedded systems and robotics, my focus remains on ensuring that every detail—big or small—is aligned toward a larger goal. By combining technical rigor with a broad perspective, I aim to create technologies that are not only innovative but also transformative, connecting the digital and physical worlds in ways that improve our everyday lives.
